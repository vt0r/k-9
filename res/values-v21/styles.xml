    <!-- On Lollipop, notifications are on white rather than on dark grey, making
         the title too light. When using targetSdk 17, #ffffffff (which should be
         white) is being used as a mask or inverted (not sure which). The net
         effect is that specifying #ffffffff is resulting in black text. This
         needs to change once we go to targetSdk 21. -->
